#BlinkReminder#
WebExtension for Firefox. Reminds the user to blink and look away from the monitor regularly to prevent eye stain and dry eye.

#Installation#
The addon is available on Mozialla addons page https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/blink-reminder/

# Contributing #
Contributions and improvements are welcome. The extension is meant to run on Firefox, it should work on Chrome as well but I have not tested it.
The reason I use the chrome.* namespace in the code is because there are currently no TypeScript definitions for Firefox.
