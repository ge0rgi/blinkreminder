#BlinkReminder#
WebExtension for Firefox. Reminds the user to blink and look away from the monitor regularly to prevent eye stain and dry eye.

Contributions and improvements are welcome. The extension is meant to run on Firefox, it should work on Chrome as well but I have not tested it.
The reason I use the chrome.* namespace in the code is because there are currently no TypeScript definitions for Firefox.
